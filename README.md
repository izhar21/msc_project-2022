# Visual Sentiment Analysis

This repo contains the PyTorch-converted models for textual and visual sentiment analysis using different models for each analysis and finding the best model for each analysis.

For textual analysis:

        Models:
        1) Bernoulli Naive Bayes model
        2) Logistic Regression model
        3) Support Vector Machine (SVM)
        
        For Further details and setps check the textual_analysis file.
        
For Visual anlayis:
        
        Models:
        1) VGG-19 model
        2) DenseNet121 model
        3) ResNet50V2 model
        
        For Further details and setps check the visual_analysis file.
